# Porygon v1.0
![](PorygonLogo.png)

A Discord/Showdown/Google-Sheets bot that keeps track of deaths and kills as they happen live in a Pokemon Showdown battle.
This bot uses [sports.psim.us](http://sports.psim.us/) rather than the [official Showdown page](http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/).

## Usage
If you're going to make your own version of the bot, then do the following to run it properly: 
```bash
npm install
node index.js
```

## Contributing
Just make a PR or an issue, and I'll probably accept it.

## Roadmap
The bot is, of course, not perfect. As such, there are always improvements to be made. This is the list of improvements I have in mind for the future: 
- Make a v2.0 that doesn't just attribute the death/kill to the opponent pokemon on the field, but rather the pokemon that dealt the move that eventually resulted in the pokemon's death.
- Improve discord functionality with more functions that might be helpful to the average PS user.
